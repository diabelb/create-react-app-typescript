## Setup

Install create-react-app
```sh
$ npm install -g create-react-app
```
Run react-scripts-redux-ts installation
```sh
$ create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-redux-ts

## Code Generators
#### Component generator
You can easily generate 3 types of component - stateful, stateful-redux and stateless.

Just run command:
```sh
$ npm run create:component
```
Answer simple questions:
```sh
? What's your component name? test/Test
? What's your component type? stateful-redux
```

And done ;)
```sh
Loaded templates: _templates
       added: src/components/test/Test.tsx
       added: src/__tests__/components/test/Test.test.tsx
```
#### Redux store item generator
To generate redux store item just run:

```sh
npm run store:create:item
```

and answer question:
```sh
? What's your store item's name? user
```

it'll create and update several files
```sh
Loaded templates: _templates
       added: src/store/actions/user/userActions.ts
      inject: src/store/actions/index.ts
      inject: src/store/actions/index.ts
